## Trending YouTube Videos

YouTube is a global online platform for sharing, creating, and commenting on video.  According to Statista.com, YouTube has over 2.5 billion active monthly users.  Out of the billions of hours of content, YouTube maintains a list of Top Trending Videos that gets updated every 15 minutes.

Out of all that factors that can make a video trend, does the category of interest a video covers matter?  For example, do videos about the news trend as much as those about sports?  Do videos in different categories have a similar level of engagement by YouTube's audience?  

With this understanding, for example, a prospective content creator will know if the category of a video impacts the video trends and it's engagement.  In addition, advertisers will know where to focus for maxium visibility.

Let's attempt to answer these questions using a kaggle [dataset by Mitchell J](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new) that contain several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos.  I will use the english speaking countries:  United States, Canada, and Great Britian.
